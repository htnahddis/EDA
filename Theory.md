## Handling Missing Value
 Delete Rows, Replacing with mean/median/mode, algorithmic imputation, prediction of missing value.

Feature scaling is a preprocessing technique in machine learning that transforms numerical features to a common scale, preventing features with larger ranges from dominating models. It involves methods like normalization (scaling to a specific range, like 0 to 1) or standardization (scaling to a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1). This ensures that all features contribute equally to the model's learning process and improves its performance, especially for distance-based and gradient-based algorithms.
